## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

For most of this challenge I did not have access to Figma's developer mode. The design files provided by Frontend Mentor were modified slightly (mostly small layout changes) between when I started the project and when I completed it, so I was working with 2 different design files.
